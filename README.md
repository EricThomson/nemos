# nemos
A toolbox of statistical analysis for neuroscience. 

## Setup

To install, clone this repo and install using `pip`:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:flatironinstitute/generalized-linear-models.git
cd generalized-linear-models/
pip install -e .
```

If you have a GPU, you may need to install jax separately to get the proper
build. The following has worked for me on a Flatiron Linux workstation: `conda
install jax cuda-nvcc -c conda-forge -c nvidia`. Note this should be done
without `jax` and `jaxlib` already installed, so either run this before the
earlier `pip install` command or uninstall them first (`pip uninstall jax
jaxlib`). See [jax docs](https://github.com/google/jax#conda-installation) for
details (the `pip` instructions did not work for me).
