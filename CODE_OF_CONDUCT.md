**Our Mission**: We aspire to build a community-driven, open library dedicated to neuroscientific analysis. As such, we foster friendly discussions encompassing both the contents of the package and the underlying theory.

**Core Values**:
  - **Inclusivity**: Every contribution is valuable. We recognize and appreciate the diversity of our community members and their contributions.
  - **Equality**: We are committed to treating everyone with fairness and impartiality. Discrimination or favoritism has no place in our community.
  - **Professionalism**: We expect our community members to maintain a high standard of conduct. Inappropriate or disrespectful language will not be tolerated.

**Contribution**: We welcome code submissions, improvements to documentation, tutorials, active participation in discussions, and revisions to pull requests.

We follow the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/
