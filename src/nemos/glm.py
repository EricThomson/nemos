class GLM(BaseRegressor):
    """
    Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for neural activity data.

    This GLM implementation allows users to model neural activity based on a combination of exogenous inputs
    (like convolved currents or light intensities) and a choice of observation model. It is suitable for scenarios where
    the relationship between predictors and the response variable might be non-linear, and the residuals
    don't follow a normal distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observation_model :
        Observation model to use. The model describes the distribution of the neural activity.
        Default is the Poisson model.
    regularizer :
        Regularization to use for model optimization. Defines the regularization scheme, the optimization algorithm,
        and related parameters.
        Default is Ridge regression with gradient descent.

    Attributes
    ----------
    intercept_ :
        Model baseline linked firing rate parameters, e.g. if the link is the logarithm, the baseline
        firing rate will be `jnp.exp(model.intercept_)`.
    coef_ :
        Basis coefficients for the model.
    solver_state :
        State of the solver after fitting. May include details like optimization error.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If provided `regularizer` or `observation_model` are not valid or implemented in `nemos.solver` and
        `nemos.observation_models` respectively.

            self.intercept_.shape[0]``).

        Notes
        -----
        The log-likelihood is not on a standard scale, its value is influenced by many factors,
        among which the number of model parameters. The log-likelihood can assume both positive
        and negative values.

        The Pseudo-$ R^2 $ is not equivalent to the $ R^2 $ value in linear regression. While both
        provide a measure of model fit, and assume values in the [0,1] range, the methods and
        interpretations can differ. The Pseudo-$ R^2 $ is particularly useful for generalized linear
        models when the interpretation of the $ R^2 $ as explained variance does not apply
        (i.e., when the observations are not Gaussian distributed).

        Why does the traditional $R^2$ is usually a poor measure of performance in GLMs?

        1.  In the context of GLMs the variance and the mean of the observations are related.
        Ignoring the relation between them can result in underestimating the model
        performance; for instance, when we model a Poisson variable with large mean we expect an
        equally large variance. In this scenario, even if our model perfectly captures the mean,
        the high-variance  will result in large residuals and low $R^2$.
        Additionally, when the mean of the observations varies, the variance will vary too. This
        violates the "homoschedasticity" assumption, necessary  for interpreting the $R^2$ as
        variance explained.
        2. The $R^2$ capture the variance explained when the relationship between the observations and
        the predictors is linear. In GLMs, the link function sets a non-linear mapping between the predictors
        and the mean of the observations, compromising the interpretation of the $R^2$.

        Note that it is possible to re-normalized the residuals by a mean-dependent quantity proportional
        to the model standard deviation (i.e. Pearson residuals). This "rescaled" residual distribution however
        deviates substantially from normality for counting data with low mean (common for spike counts).
        Therefore, even the Pearson residuals performs poorly as a measure of fit quality, especially
        for GLM modeling counting data.

        Refer to the `nmo.observation_models.Observations` concrete subclasses for the likelihood and
        pseudo-$R^2$ equations.

        [predict](./#nemos.glm.GLM.predict) :
        Method to predict rates based on the model's parameters.

        Notes
        -----
        The model coefficients (`self.coef_`) are structured such that the first set of coefficients
        (of size `n_basis_coupling * n_neurons`) are interpreted as the weights for the recurrent couplings.
        The remaining coefficients correspond to the weights for the feed-forward input.


        The sum of `n_basis_input` and `n_basis_coupling * n_neurons` should equal `self.coef_.shape[1]`
        to ensure consistency in the model's input feature dimensionality.
