        The Poisson probably mass function is:

        .. math::
Â¨           -\log{\frac{\lambda^k\exp{-\lambda}}{k!}} &= -[\log(\lambda^k)+\log(\exp{-\lambda})-\log(k!)]
           &= -k\log(\lambda)-\lambda+\log(\Gamma(k+1))

        Because $\Gamma(k+1)=k!$, see
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function.

        And, in our case, ``target_spikes`` is $k$ and
